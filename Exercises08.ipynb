Following Greene and Ho, we will make a linear fit between the variables $\\log M$ and $\\log \\left( \\frac{\\sigma_*}{\\sigma_0} \\right)$  where the constant $\\sigma_0 = 200$ is a reference value given by the authors. Add a column for this log of the velocity dispersion and make a scatter plot showing the data $\\log_\\mathrm{10} M$ as a function of $\\log_\\mathrm{10}\n",
